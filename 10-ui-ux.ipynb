    "> Additionally, I recommend looking into Laws of UX (https://lawsofux.com/)  to familiarize yourself with best practices. From now on, I encourage you to become mindful observersâ€”notice the apps and websites you use daily, look for patterns, and observe how UI elements are applied. Challenge the design choices, reflect on frustrating experiences as well as delightful ones, and keep those insights in mind. This practice will help you build a strong knowledge base and refine your intuition as you create your own projects.\n"
